<h3>Surfs Up</h3>
<p>The mockumentry style animation is so classic. Also, Chicken Joe just has so much style.</p>

<h3>When Harry Met Sally</h3>
<p>Perfect Rom-Com that the wife showed me.<br/> 
An instant classic that I've been missing out on.</p>

<h3>Hereditary</h3>
<p>Modern day horror classic that reignited my craving for horror movies.</p>
